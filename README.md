# Pestapboots Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: October 6, 2025**

Pestapboots ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, Pestapboots (the "App"), available on the Google Play Store. The App allows users to watch live streams via an embedded TikTok WebView, authenticate via one-time passwords (OTP), receive notifications, and check lottery coupon data. By using the App, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App. This policy complies with applicable laws, including GDPR (for EU users) and CCPA (for California residents), where relevant.

### 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide and improve the App's functionality. We only collect what is necessary.

#### 1.1 Personal Information
- **Phone Number**: Collected during OTP authentication for login and verification. This is used solely for sending temporary OTP codes and is not stored long-term unless required for account recovery (up to 30 days).
- **No Other Personal Data**: We do not collect names, emails, addresses, or payment information.

#### 1.2 Device and Usage Information
- **Device Identifiers**: Unique device IDs, IP address, and OS version (e.g., Android version) for crash reporting and analytics.
- **Notification Data**: Device tokens via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending push notifications about live streams or lottery updates.
- **Usage Logs**: App interactions (e.g., login attempts, WebView loads) to improve performance.
- **[NEW] Local Storage**: Temporary data (e.g., OTP codes) is stored locally using shared preferences and deleted upon logout or app uninstall.

#### 1.3 Third-Party Data
- **TikTok WebView**: When viewing live streams, TikTok's privacy policy applies[](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy). We do not access TikTok user data; any interactions occur directly with TikTok.
- **API Data**: Queries to our server (kurtong.com) for OTP and lottery coupon data (e.g., hashed phone numbers for verification). No sensitive data is transmitted beyond what is necessary.

We do not collect location data, camera/microphone access, or biometric information.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected information for:
- **Authentication**: Sending OTPs to verify phone numbers.
- **Notifications**: Delivering push notifications (e.g., live stream alerts) via Firebase.
- **App Functionality**: Fetching lottery data and loading WebView content.
- **Analytics and Improvement**: Aggregated, anonymized data to debug issues and enhance features (e.g., via Firebase Analytics, if enabled).
- **Security**: Detecting fraudulent activity (e.g., invalid OTPs).

Under GDPR, this processing is based on your consent (e.g., notification opt-in requested upon first use) or legitimate interests (e.g., app security). Under CCPA, we do not "sell" personal information.

### 3. Sharing Your Information

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing. Limited sharing occurs as follows:
- **Service Providers**: Firebase (Google) for notifications and analytics; kurtong.com server for OTP/lottery processing. These providers are bound by data protection agreements.
- **TikTok**: Indirectly via WebView; TikTok handles its own data per their policy.
- **Legal Requirements**: If required by law, subpoena, or to protect rights/safety.

No data is shared with advertisers, as the App is ad-free.

### 4. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures (e.g., HTTPS encryption for API calls, secure OTP hashing) to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Phone numbers are hashed (using MD5 in the App, with stronger methods on the server) before transmission where possible. Data is retained only as long as needed (e.g., OTPs expire in minutes; device tokens until unsubscribed; account recovery data up to 30 days).

### 5. Your Rights and Choices

You have control over your data:
- **Access/Update/Delete**: Contact us to request access, correction, or deletion of your phone number or notification preferences.
- **Opt-Out**: Unsubscribe from notifications via App settings or device settings. Under GDPR/CCPA, you can withdraw consent at any time.
- **Do Not Track**: We honor browser/app Do Not Track signals where applicable.
- **[EDIT] CCPA Rights**: California residents can request disclosure of personal information collected, confirm we do not sell data, or request deletion. No "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link is provided as we do not engage in sales of data.
- **GDPR Rights**: EU users can access, rectify, erase, restrict, or object to processing; data portability; or lodge complaints with supervisory authorities.

To exercise rights, email us (see Contact section). We respond within 30 days.

### 6. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13 (or 16 in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn of such collection, we will delete it promptly. Parents/guardians: Contact us if you believe your child has provided data.

### 7. International Data Transfers

Data may be processed in Indonesia (our servers) or the US (Firebase). We ensure adequate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses for GDPR) for cross-border transfers. [NEW] We comply with Indonesian data protection practices where applicable.

### 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in the App or laws. Significant changes will be notified via the App or email (if available). Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. Check this page periodically.
